## Tips for Electronics Parts

### Material Selection

| Application | Recommended | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Enclosures | PETG, ABS | Durable, easy to print |
| Mounts | PETG, PLA | Low stress applications |
| Heat sinks | PLA | Actually works for passive cooling |
| Cable management | TPU, PETG | Flexibility helps |

### Considerations

- Ventilation for heat dissipation
- Access to ports and buttons
- EMI shielding (not possible with standard filaments)
- Snap-fit tolerances
