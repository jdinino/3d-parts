## Tips for Automotive Parts

### Material Selection

| Application | Recommended | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Interior trim | ABS, ASA, PETG | UV resistant for sun exposure |
| Under hood | ABS, ASA, Nylon | High temp resistance required |
| Clips/Fasteners | PETG, Nylon | Flexibility needed |
| Exterior | ASA | Best UV resistance |

### Considerations

- High temperatures in engine bay and sun-exposed areas
- UV degradation for exterior parts
- Vibration resistance
- Chemical exposure (oils, fuels, cleaners)
